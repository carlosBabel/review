<p><b>Los Patos</b> is one of my favourite restaurants in Granada because
it is situated in the center of the city but at the same time looks like you are in the countryside.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is worth the money since obviously is more expensive
but you are paying for an exclusive environment and delicious mediterranean food, including a welcoming service.</p>
<p>You cant just choose one dish from their variated menu. Anything you have from the superb
menu will accomplish your expectations, like their croquetas
or their spetial gazpacho.</p>
<p>Where this restaurant brights the most, is in the interior. It is
pretty much more airy than you would expect and it has a fountain that makes you feel cool in the summer. The furniture
is modern and elegant but at the same time the d√©cor
makes you feel like if you were in La Alhambra.</p>
<p>I really recommend to you to give it a chance, espetially if you want to celebrate a spetial event or maybe succeed
in a first date. Just an advice, prepare your wallet because you have to pay for the quality</p>
